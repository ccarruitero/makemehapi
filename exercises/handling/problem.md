Create a server which responds to requests to `/` with a static HTML file named
`index.html` containing the following:

```html
<html>
    <head><title>Hello Handling</title></head>
    <body>
        Hello Handling
    </body>
</html>
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------
##HINTS

This exercise requires you to install the `inert` module, which is a hapi plugin
for serving static files and directories. You'll need to register the plugin in
your code in order to serve static files:

```js
var Inert = require('inert');

await server.register(Inert);
```

You can declare handlers as objects instead of functions. The object must
contain one of the following: `file` (requires `inert` plugin), `directory`
(requires `inert` plugin), `proxy` (requires `h2o2` plugin), or `view` (requires
`vision` plugin).

For example, `handler` can be assigned an object with the `file` key:

```js
handler: {
    file: "index.html"
}
```

Be careful: in practice, you'll need to provide an absolute path to an
`index.html` file in your program's directory. To achieve this, you'll probably
need the `path` core module, its `join()` function, and the `__dirname` global
variable.
